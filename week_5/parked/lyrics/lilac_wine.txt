I lost myself on a cool, damp night
I gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree

I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see
And be what I want to be

When I think more than I want to think
I do things I never should do
I drink much more than I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you

Lilac wine is sweet and heady
Like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady
Like my love

Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she coming to me?
Nearly here

Lilac wine is sweet and heady
Where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady
Where's my love?

Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that she, or am I just going
Crazy, dear?

Lilac wine, I feel unready
For my love
Feel unready
For my love
